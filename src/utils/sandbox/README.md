# Sandbox

Sandbox is a lightweight WebGL wrapper for **simple, beautiful shader effects**. It focuses on a clean API, type safety, and fast setup so you can go from idea to a shader in minutes.

It's **DX‑friendly**, small, and intentionally minimal — perfect for gradients, ambient backgrounds, and animated GLSL experiments. If you're not building a full 3D engine, Sandbox is a delightful alternative to larger libraries like three.js or p5.js.

It works in both **WebGL1 and WebGL2** contexts, with automatic fallback and detection.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @rosalana/sandbox
```

## Quick setup

Sandbox is designed to get you up and running with minimal effort. It ships with sensible defaults, so in most cases it only takes a few lines of code to get started.

```ts
import { Sandbox } from "@rosalana/sandbox";

const sandbox = Sandbox.create(canvas, {
  fragment: fragSource,
});
```

That's it. You get a running render loop and a fullscreen quad. No WebGL ceremony, no boilerplate — just your shader doing its thing.

## Playback control

Autoplay is enabled by default, so your shader starts rendering immediately. But you're in full control — pause, play, scrub through time, whatever you need.

```ts
sandbox.play();
sandbox.pause();
sandbox.toggle();
```

Want to know if it's running?

```ts
sandbox.isPlaying();
```

### Time control

This is where it gets fun. You can jump to any point in time, which is perfect for debugging or creating deterministic renders.

Start playing from a specific moment:

```ts
sandbox.playAt(2.5);
```

Or set up an auto-pause — great for intro animations that should stop after a few seconds:

```ts
sandbox.pauseAt(10);
```

### Static rendering

Sometimes you don't need animation at all. Maybe you're generating a gradient thumbnail or rendering a single frame for export.

```ts
const sandbox = Sandbox.create(canvas, {
  fragment: fragSource,
  autoplay: false,
});

sandbox.render();
```

Or render at a specific time — perfect for deterministic, reproducible output:

```ts
sandbox.renderAt(1.5);
```

## Shaders

Shaders are the only thing you need to provide. Sandbox comes with a default fullscreen vertex shader, so you usually don't need to write one yourself — and it automatically switches between WebGL1 and WebGL2 versions depending on your fragment shader.

Update your fragment shader on the fly:

```ts
sandbox.setFragment(fragmentSource);
```

When you need full control over both vertex and fragment:

```ts
sandbox.setShader(vertexSource, fragmentSource);
```

### WebGL version detection

Sandbox figures out which WebGL version you're using by looking at your shader code:

- `#version 300 es` → WebGL2
- no version directive → WebGL1

If WebGL2 isn't available, Sandbox falls back to WebGL1 automatically. You can always check what you're running:

```ts
sandbox.webglVersion();
```

## Uniforms

Uniforms are how you feed data into your shader. Sandbox makes them **type‑safe** and **chainable** — no more guessing what went wrong.

Set a single uniform:

```ts
sandbox.setUniform<number>("u_intensity", 0.8);
```

Set multiple uniforms at once:

```ts
sandbox.setUniforms<{
  u_intensity: number;
  u_color: Vec3;
}>({
  u_intensity: 0.75,
  u_color: [1, 0.2, 0.3],
});
```

Read back a uniform value:

```ts
const intensity = sandbox.getUniform<number>("u_intensity");
```

All numeric values are treated as floats. This keeps the API simple and predictable.

## Built‑in uniforms

These uniforms are filled automatically every frame — no setup needed. Just declare them in your shader and they work:

| Uniform        | Type  | Description                 |
| -------------- | ----- | --------------------------- |
| `u_resolution` | vec2  | Canvas size in pixels       |
| `u_time`       | float | Elapsed time (seconds)      |
| `u_delta`      | float | Delta time since last frame |
| `u_mouse`      | vec2  | Mouse position on canvas    |
| `u_frame`      | int   | Frame counter               |

## Hooks

Hooks are one of the most powerful features in Sandbox. They let you run logic every frame — before or after render — which opens up a world of possibilities.

**Pre-compute values on the CPU** before they hit the shader:

```ts
sandbox.hook(({ time }) => {
  const intensity = (Math.sin(time) + 1) / 2;
  sandbox.setUniform("u_intensity", intensity);
}, "before");
```

**Sync state with reactive frameworks** like Vue or React:

```ts
const playing = ref(false);

sandbox.hook(() => {
  playing.value = sandbox.isPlaying();
}, "after");
```

The hook returns a removal function, so you can clean up whenever you want:

```ts
const remove = sandbox.hook(({ time }) => {
  console.log(time);
}, "after");

remove();
```

### Self-removing hooks

Sometimes you need a hook that runs only until a condition is met. Just return `false` and the hook removes itself:

```ts
sandbox.hook(({ time }) => {
  if (time > 5) return false;
}, "after");
```

This is how `pauseAt()` works internally — it's hooks all the way down.

## Chaining

Every method returns `this`, so you can chain calls for clean, expressive code:

```ts
sandbox
  .setUniforms({ u_color: [1, 0, 0] })
  .time(2.5)
  .render();
```

## Error handling

Shader errors happen — typos, syntax mistakes, driver quirks. Sandbox handles them gracefully and reports them via a single callback. No try/catch needed.

```ts
Sandbox.create(canvas, {
  fragment: shader,
  onError: (error) => {
    console.error(error.message);
  },
});
```

The error object includes useful details:

- `error.code` — error type (`SHADER_COMPILATION_FAILED`, `PROGRAM_LINK_FAILED`, etc.)
- `error.lines` — line numbers where errors occurred (for compilation errors)
- `error.shaderType` — which shader failed (`vertex` or `fragment`)

Error codes: `WEBGL_NOT_SUPPORTED`, `SHADER_COMPILATION_FAILED`, `PROGRAM_LINK_FAILED`, `SHADER_VERSION_MISMATCH`

## Vue integration

Here's a complete example showing how to use Sandbox with Vue's reactivity system:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { shallowRef, ref, onMounted, onUnmounted } from "vue";
import { Sandbox } from "@rosalana/sandbox";

const canvasRef = ref<HTMLCanvasElement>();
const sandbox = shallowRef<Sandbox | null>(null);
const isPlaying = ref(false);

onMounted(() => {
  sandbox.value = Sandbox.create(canvasRef.value!, {
    onAfterRender: () => {
      isPlaying.value = sandbox.value?.isPlaying() ?? false;
    },
  });
});

onUnmounted(() => {
  sandbox.value?.destroy();
});
</script>

<template>
  {{ isPlaying ? "Playing" : "Paused" }}
  <canvas ref="canvasRef" />
</template>
```

Use `shallowRef` for the Sandbox instance — you don't want Vue making the WebGL context reactive.

## Cleanup

Always destroy when you're done. This releases all WebGL resources and removes event listeners:

```ts
sandbox.destroy();
```

In frameworks like Vue:

```ts
onUnmounted(() => {
  sandbox.destroy();
});
```

## Options

```ts
interface SandboxOptions {
  vertex?: string;
  fragment?: string;
  autoplay?: boolean;
  pauseWhenHidden?: boolean;
  dpr?: number | "auto";
  preserveDrawingBuffer?: boolean;
  antialias?: boolean;
  onError?: (error: SandboxError) => void;
  onLoad?: () => void;
  onBeforeRender?: HookCallback | null;
  onAfterRender?: HookCallback | null;
  uniforms?: UniformSchema;
}
```

| Option                  | Default       | Description                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `vertex`                | built-in      | Custom vertex shader            |
| `fragment`              | built-in      | Fragment shader                 |
| `autoplay`              | `true`        | Start rendering immediately     |
| `pauseWhenHidden`       | `true`        | Pause when scrolled out of view |
| `dpr`                   | `"auto"`      | Device pixel ratio              |
| `preserveDrawingBuffer` | `false`       | Keep buffer for screenshots     |
| `antialias`             | `true`        | Enable antialiasing             |
| `onError`               | `console.error` | Error callback                  |
| `onLoad`                | —             | Called when ready               |
| `onBeforeRender`        | —             | Hook before each frame          |
| `onAfterRender`         | —             | Hook after each frame           |
| `uniforms`              | —             | Initial uniform values          |

## Limitations (by design)

- No textures (planned for future)
- No multi‑pass rendering
- No 3D scene graph

If you need a full engine, reach for three.js. For clean shader‑only effects, Sandbox is a joy to use.
